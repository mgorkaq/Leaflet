In this assignement we are going to use two locations in Lausanne, Switzerland.

```{r}
locations <- data.frame( lat = c(46.520452,46.531719),
                         lng = c(6.572277,6.646033),
                         labels = c("Forensic Science School", "La Salle Training Center"))

m <- leaflet(locations) %>% addTiles %>% addMarkers(label = ~labels)
m
```
